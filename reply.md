Hi Alice,

I investigated the issue with `site.recruitment.shq.nz`. 
The site is currently resolving to the correct IP (`120.138.30.179`), but it is displaying a "Website Not Found" message. Screenshot can be found in (image.png)
This typically happens when the web server is misconfigured or when the domain is not properly mapped to a site on the server.
  
### Suggested Resolution
Please check the following on your server:
1. Verify that the web server has a virtual host configured for `site.recruitment.shq.nz`.
2. Ensure that the site's files are in the correct directory.
3. Restart the web server to apply any configuration changes.

If you need further assistance with these steps, I recommend contacting your hosting provider.

Cheers,  
Han Juin
